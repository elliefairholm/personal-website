# personal-website

This is the repository for my personal website. At the moment, there is only the front-end, but the back end is coming soon, as soon as I write some blog posts....

I learnt Vue.js in less than a week for this project, and hope to use this website to keep track of my progress as a Full-Stack Software Engineer.
