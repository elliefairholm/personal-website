# personal-website

This is the repository for the front-end of my personal website.

You can find my back-end repository here: [https://github.com/elliefairholm/personal-website-server](https://github.com/elliefairholm/personal-website-server).

I learnt Vue.js in less than a week for this project, and hope to use this website to keep track of my progress as a Full-Stack Software Engineer.
